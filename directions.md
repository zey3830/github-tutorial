# GitHub Tutorial Project

## _Overview_  

* Using markdown syntax, display all of your knowledge about **Git** and **Github** in a single README file.  

## _Directions_

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Notice there are two files:  
    a. `README.md` is where you will find a template to use as a starting point for your tutorial. This is where you'll do your work.  
    b. `directions.md` is where you will find these directions.
3. As you edit, make a commit every once in a while.  Don't forget to push!  

## _Topics_

* git vs github overview
  * explain what each is, and the difference between the two
  * [10%]
* one-time setup
  * making a github account (you don't need to go in much depth)
  * how to set up their IDE
    * you can simply link to the directions that **you followed** to setup YOUR ide!

### A note about plagiarism
You should be typing _every single word_.  It is ok to refer to your notes, the slides, the internet, and even your classmates for help.  However, **intellectual property is to be regarded highly in this class**.  You should be explaining everything in your own words.  If you are copying/pasting, you are not learning.

### Assumptions
Should you assume your reader is a student at HSTAT?  Should you assume they already use the CS50 IDE?  It is _up to you_ to decide what assumptions you will make.  But perhaps the best strategy is to speak to all audiences with hints for HSTAT / ide50.  
i.e. making a Github account:
> Choose a username (if you are a student at HSTAT, use your HSTAT email, but without the `@hstat.org`).

### Final thoughts
The best way to learn something is through repeated practice.  
Feel free to **practice** all of these concepts on your own to understand them better.  
Don't forget to use [Google](http://www.google.com) if you get stuck!

### Platform alternative
The purpose of this project is to synthesize your learning by creating a tutorial that someone else could hypothetically follow. Using Github as a platform for the tutorial is an extra bonus because it provides extra practice for YOU, the creator of the tutorial. _However_, many students in the past have expressed interest in creating the tutorial via a different platform, i.e. making a video. **You get to decide the platform**. Please browse these [Digital Artifact Tools](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-wI7-CuHMkZL3PkKwHnxVbfZbTSP6gqV2But1owgM-E/edit#gid=0) to consider an alternative platform to Github.

Bottom line: the recommendation is that you use Github to make your **Github Tutorial**. But feel free to choose a different creation tool!
